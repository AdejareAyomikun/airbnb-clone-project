# airbnb-clone-project
# Project Description
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

# Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

Learn to implement responsive UI/UX designs
Understand how to structure a complex web application
Practice working in a team with defined roles
Develop skills in component-based frontend architecture
Learn best practices for web application development

# Requirements
Project Initialization

Set up GitHub repository with proper documentation
Include comprehensive README with project overview
UI/UX Design Planning

Document design goals and key features
Create page descriptions for main views
Analyze Figma design specifications
Identify color schemes and typography
Roles and Responsibilities

Define team structure and responsibilities
Document each roleâ€™s contribution to the project
UI Component Patterns

Plan reusable UI components

Accessibility: Follow WCAG guidelines
Documentation: Keep all project documentation updated
Testing: Implement unit and integration tests

## Database Design

Key entities and their attributes:

- **Users**  
  - ID, Name, Email, Password, Role  
  - Users can list properties and make bookings.

- **Properties**  
  - ID, Title, Description, Location, Price, OwnerID  
  - A property belongs to a user.

- **Bookings**  
  - ID, UserID, PropertyID, StartDate, EndDate  
  - A booking belongs to both a user and a property.

- **Reviews**  
  - ID, UserID, PropertyID, Rating, Comment  
  - Users can leave reviews for properties they have booked.

- **Payments**  
  - ID, BookingID, Amount, Status, PaymentDate  
  - Payments are linked to a specific booking.

## API Security

Key measures to be implemented:
- **Authentication**  
  Using tokens or OAuth to verify user identity.
- **Authorization**  
  Restricting access based on user roles and permissions.
- **Rate Limiting**  
  Prevents abuse of APIs by limiting requests.
- **Data Encryption**  
  Protects sensitive information like passwords and payment details.

Security is crucial to protect user data, ensure trust, and secure financial transactions.

## CI/CD Pipeline

**What is CI/CD?**  
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) streamline the process of testing, building, and deploying the application.

**Tools to be used:**
- **GitHub Actions** for automation  
- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Heroku or AWS** for deployment environments

Benefits:
- Faster development cycles  
- Reduced risk of bugs in production  
- Seamless deployment and rollback options

# Design Goals
Create intuitive booking flow
Maintain visual consistency
Ensure fast loading times
Prioritize mobile responsiveness
# Key Features
Property search and filtering
Detailed property viewing
Secure checkout process
User authentication
